# Borrowed Time
_~5 minute read_

An in-chip countermeasure for static side-channel analysis attacks built for deployment in FPGAs. 


### Basic principles of use and security relevance
Static side-channel analysis exploits leakage of circuit state elements while their stored values are not changing. Typically inducing such a state requires stopping the circuit input clock. Our countermeasure serves to monitor the clock signal and upon detecting a stop condition, immediately wipe sensitive register contents in a secure manner. 

## Paper report
These designs are artefacts of research that has been published in a paper titled _On Borrowed Time â€“ Preventing Static Side-Channel Analysis_, to appear in [NDSS '25]([https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/)). Preprint available online [here](https://github.com/0xADE1A1DE/Borrowed-Time/...) or [arXiv]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01109](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09001)).

## Protected targets
This repo contains design files for two cryptographic systems that implemented directly in hardware, each of which is equipped with the Borrowed Time countermeasure.
Each instance is designed for implementation on a specific target IC since the countermeasure operates based on the physical properties of the underlying technology.

- `AES128' - Round-based implementation - No other side-channel analysis countermeasures - deployment on Xilinx Kintex 7
- `SKINNY-128-128' - first-order masking protection - deployment on Xilinx Spartan 6

Porting these designs to other targets requires some additional engineering, namely to ensure the delay-chain circuits are correctly tuned. See paper for more information.
